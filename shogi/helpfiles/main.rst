Reference for pieces
--------------------

There are several ways to refer to pieces in the interactive prompt. These are:

- The full piece name, e.g. "pawn", or "+bishop" (for promoted pieces)

- The shortened abbreviation, e.g. "p" or "B"

- The 2-letter piece definition, e.g. "pw" or "Bb"

**Important:** In the shortened and 2-letter abbreviations, the knight is
written as an *n*, and not a *k*. All other pieces' abbreviations are the same
as their first letters.
