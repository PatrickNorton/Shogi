Shogi Notation:

Basic Notation:
    Of the form [Piece]-[Location].
    This is what most moves consist of, however, some are more complex.
    If two identical pieces could move to the same location, then there is an
    additional partial coordinate added to the move before the dash, for
    clarification.

The Dash:
    The dash between the two halves of the move can change as well.
    If the dash is replaced by an x, then the move involved capturing a piece.
    If the dash is replaced by a *, then the move was a drop.

Additional add-ons:
    If the piece was eligible for promotion, then there is another character.
    If the piece was promoted, then there is a * added.
    Otherwise, there is an = added.
    If the move checked the king, a + is added.
    On checkmate, there is a # added to the end.
