Prompt help:

The game of shogi has three types of expected input.
These types are delineated by both the prompt and the character on the prompt.

Location input (:)
    This input expects a location on the board.
    Locations are in the form letter+number, for example a7.
    The letter specifies the row, and the number the column on the board.

Piece input (>)
    This input expects the name of a piece.
    There are three things you can enter:
        The first letter of the piece's representation (p, n)
        The piece's representation on the board (pb, nw)
        The full name of the piece (pawn, knight)

Binary input (])
    This input expects one of two answers to a question.
    If the answer is yes, type y
    If the answer is no, type n
