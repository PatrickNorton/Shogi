You can't move that there!
There is a piece in the way!
You can't move a piece to where it already is!
You can't capture your own piece!
That is not your piece!
You cannot move into check!
You have no pieces to drop!
You cannot capture with a drop!
You cannot put two pawns in the same column!
You don't have this piece!
